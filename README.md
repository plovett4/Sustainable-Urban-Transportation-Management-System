## How to Run the Project
First, run the 'TB_login' SQL script inside your MySQL Workbench instance, then go into the 'app.py' file
and add your corresponding SQL user and password. The final step is to add your own free TomTom API key to
the 'var apiKey' on the first line inside the very first <script> tags. From there you can run the application
on your localhost, port 5000
